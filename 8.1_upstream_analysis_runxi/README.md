# VarChAMP Upstream Analyses for Metadata QC

__Auther: Runxi Shen__

In this subfolder, we examine the metadata for each genetic variant and the layouts of 384-well platemaps for screening them through Variant Painting imaging. 

## 1. metadata_qc

Download the platemaps information from cell-painting gallery from aws and the corresponding metadata of genetic variants provided by Taipale Lab at UofT, and cross-check them for data consistency and data formats.

If the original platemap information downloaded from aws needs further correction due to changes in experimental set-ups and inconsistent file formatting, etc., we need to correct for the platemap information in this directory and re-uploaded the files to the aws cell-painting gallery.
