# Downstream Analyses of Calling Variant Hits

## 1. General Analyses

### 1.1 Cell Count Differences

We want to first test if there is a significant shift in cell counts between the reference and variant alleles from the same gene. 

Paired t-test: 

Adjusted for distance-to-edge and paired t-test on the residuals:

Mixed linear model: co-linearity issues.
